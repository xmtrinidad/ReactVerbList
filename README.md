# ReactVerbList

My first React project, covering sections 1-5 of the React tutorials from Udemy.  This project is an extension of 
a practice example I did on [Stack Blitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/section-four-practice).  The readme for that example can
be found [here](https://github.com/xmtrinidad/UdemyReact/blob/master/Section%20Four%20-%20Working%20with%20Lists%20and%20Conditionals/VerbList.md)

This project is an accumulation of things I have learned from sections 1-5 of the [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) 
I am taking on Udemy.

## New Things

As I mentioned, I originally did this project as a practice module on Stack Blitz.  There were several new things that I didn't do
for that project that I did on this one.  Below is a list of the new things I learned and the documentation for any problems I encountered:

## Adding Bootstrap

## Changing file extensions for VSCode

## Getting inputs from a component with multiple inputs
